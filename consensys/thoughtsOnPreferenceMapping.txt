general model specs:
	4 voters (1-4)
	3 preferences (a-c)
	3 types of proposals (a, a&b, a&b&c)

general assumptions
	if tie, vote abstained


parameters to play with from model to model
	for and against vs intensity of preference
	representatives voting based on their values vs classifying proposals
	representatives represent a single preference vs represent a particular set of preferences

potential edge cases in simplistic model
	several representatives share the exact same set of preferences
	voter has not set preferences concerned in upcoming proposal
